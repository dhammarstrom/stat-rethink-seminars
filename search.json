The book introduces Bayesian statistics and probabilistic programming in the context of scientific research. The book helps you to develop a principled approach to statistical analysis.\nWe will meet every week for discussions. Meetings will organized as seminars where we aim to discuss the material and exercises from the book. This learning strategy requires that you are prepared to actively participate in the discussions. Preparation includes reading the relevant chapters, watching the lectures and working on the exercises.\nThe seminar series follows the same structure as the course given by Richard McElreath. Starting on the 10th of January 2025, we will meet every week for 10 weeks.",
